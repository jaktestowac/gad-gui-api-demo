</p>

This application (called **ü¶é GAD**) was prepared and developed **only for testing purposes**. It provides:

- A graphical user interface (GUI)
- REST API
- Integrated Swagger documentation

The application includes features such as simple logic, statistics, charts, games, and various resources. It is intentionally designed with **deliberately bugs**üêõ and challenges to simulate real-world project complexities.

**ü¶é GAD** is ideal for learning test automation, refining QA techniques, and practicing with scenarios encountered in diverse, **real-world projects** with diverse real-world scenarios.

P.S. In addition, the application has some **serious design flaws** - I wonder if you will notice them?üòâ
