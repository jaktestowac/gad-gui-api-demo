Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.\n- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n- Working software is the primary measure of progress.\n- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.",
